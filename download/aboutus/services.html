<div class=entry-content><h1>Terms of Use for Uptodown.com</h1><p>The use of any page on the website Uptodown.com, including any of its subdomains and/or sections (hereafter ‘UPTODOWN’), as well as the use of any service offered on UPTODOWN or the download of computer programs from UPTODOWN, implies the full acceptance of these terms of use.</p><p>UPTODOWN is managed by Media Ingea S.L., a company domiciled at 20 Puerta del Mar Street, 4th D Floor, 29005 Málaga, Spain, and registered at the Málaga Trade Registry in volume 3350, book 2262, sheet 67, page MA-64486; with VAT number B92461524. This address should be used for any claims-related correspondence.</p><p>Should particular conditions of use exist from Media Ingea S.L. (not from third parties) for certain content, services, or products offered on UPTODOWN, those conditions shall prevail over these terms of use to the extent that incompatibilities arise. The present terms of use are divided into two sections:</p><ul><li><strong>I General website terms of use applicable to all of UPTODOWN and to all products and/or services offered or sold thereon.</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>II Intellectual and industrial property rights of UPTODOWN content and of the contributions made by developers or users to UPTODOWN.</strong></li></ul><p>The user shall be entirely liable for any losses or damages suffered by Media Ingea, S.L. as a consequence of any use of UPTODOWN that does not comply with the provisions established in any part of these terms of use or in any other section of the UPTODOWN website. The user further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the company Media Ingea, S.L., as well as its administrators, personnel, agents, and representatives, from any claims in which they may be implicated as a consequence of such user noncompliance.</p><h1>I GENERAL WEBSITE TERMS OF USE APPLICABLE TO ALL OF UPTODOWN AND TO ALL PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED OR SOLD THEREON.</h1><p>1.1 Objective of the General Terms of Use</p><p>Media Ingea S.L. offers the user via UPTODOWN, or may offer in the future, the services, products, and complementary facilities as detailed below:</p><ul><li>a. Access to a respository of software content classified by category. This includes the download of software from UPTODOWN’s servers with the highest assurance of availability and/or speed that this may involve. In no case does this imply the sale of a license nor possession of intellectual property rights for the program, the use of which will be subject to the license, conditions, and restrictions imposed by the developer or intellectual property rights holder.</li><li>b. Search service for software content on the UPTODOWN library and directory.</li><li>c. Direct email update service for new programs and updates.</li><li>d. Periodic newsletter service for registered users covering new developments and information related to the sector or to UPTODOWN.</li><li>e. Media Ingea S.L. may, at some point, provide additional services or facilities, either free or paid.</li></ul><p>1.2 Liability for the processing and use of content</p><p>UPTODOWN does not guarantee the quality, accuracy, reliability, correctness, or morality of the data, programs, information, or opinions included on the site and in particular those expressed or entered in user forums or opinions. However, users may report presumed abuses or inappropriate uses of the site to allow UPTODOWN to review the corresponding content. In relation to the content and programs available for free download, UPTODOWN limits itself to offering an intermediary service, as established in Article 17 of Law 34/2002 of 11 July on Information Society Services and E-Commerce (‘LSSI’), by providing links and search content, while not assuming liability for said content beyond the cases expressly provided for in the aforementioned law; that is, UPTODOWN shall only accept liability when it (i) has actual knowledge that the activity or information being reported or referred is illegal or harms the assets or rights of a third party covered by compensation, and (ii) has not acted with diligence to remove or disable the corresponding link. The service provider shall be understood to have actual knowledge when a competent authority has declared the data illegal or ordered its withdrawal, or access to said data has become impossible, or the existence of the damage has been declared, and the service provider is aware of the corresponding resolution.</p><p>An identical system to the one established in the previous paragraph applies to other links to third-party sites that may be available on UPTODOWN. The inclusion of such links does not imply any relationship, recommendation, or supervision by UPTODOWN of the destination page, and UPTODOWN therefore accepts no liability for its content, except in such cases as expressly established in the LSSI.</p><p>The apps published on UPTODOWN are products created by their respective developers. This website is not directly affiliated with them. All of the brands, trademarks, product and company names or logos mentioned here are property of their respective owners. Our download site and app distribute original, unaltered software, which is obtained directly from the developers’ websites and is not modified in any way.</p><p>The user assumes as his or her exclusive liability any consequences, damages, or actions that may arise from accessing, playing, or disseminating said content. It is the responsibility of the user to verify, prior to downloading, the compatibility of the program with his or her computer and other applications, as well as its features and the advantages of downloading and installing the program on his or her system.
