Firstly the depth to scrape website results from Google, this can be 10 results per query or it can be up to 100. 100 will be slow but give you more results. 10 will be quicker but give you less results. The second option is the timeout on each proxy test, by default this is 10 seconds so if a successful connection can&#039;t be made to the target website in under 10 seconds it will class that result as failed.

<yandex:full-text>[media=https://youtu.be/DCUzyxMzOzE] Features Why should I use Search Engine Scraper? Copying URL&#039;s for each keyword&#039;s search results is a massively tedious task, especially if you have hundreds or even thousands of search queries you want to grab the ranking websites for. Then add the time to check Moz stats if needed and this may take weeks. Search Engine Scraper can do this in minutes. How does Search Engine Scraper work? Search Engine Scraper simply sends HTTP requests to Google and Bing just as your browser normally would then automatically parses the response and extracts the URL&#039;s that are returned for your search keyword / query.</yandex:full-text>

<yandex:full-text>[media=https://youtu.be/06e_FYx47ho] Features What are Do Follow Blog Comments? Ok so everyone knows the more websites/links that are pointing to your website, the higher you appear on the Google search results. Yes I know there are other things like link quality and content etc to consider but generally speaking this is true. These links can either be marked with &quot;Do follow&quot; or &quot;No follow&quot; by the website owner when they create the link. If the link is Do Follow generally it will help boost you up the Google search engine results and if its NoFollow it will have little if any effect at all. So obviously you only want DoFollow links. Now a few years ago when you posted a comment on a blog any links you added were all DoFollow so people wrote software to mass automate this leaving annoying spammy comments that caused website owners and CMS creators to make sure most comments were automatically NoFollow. Why should I use DoComment? You should use DoComment because its a great way of finding 100% free niche related spam free safe backlinks to boost your website up the Google search engine results. How does DoComment work? DoComment uses the twitter streaming API to listen to niche realated keywords you set. It then follows the links in these niche related tweets and analyzes the HTML to see if it thinks its found some DoFollow links in the comments section.</yandex:full-text>
