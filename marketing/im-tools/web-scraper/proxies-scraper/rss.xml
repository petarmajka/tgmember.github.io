<yandex:full-text>Features You simply click &quot;find proxies&quot; and the software will fire queries at Google to find websites that have huge lists, once it finds these it will scrape their lists and test each result it finds to make sure its working for you by connecting to test websites. This all happens in the background saving you hours of work. The tool has two main options. Firstly the depth to scrape website results from Google, this can be 10 results per query or it can be up to 100. 100 will be slow but give you more results. 10 will be quicker but give you less results. The second option is the timeout on each proxy test, by default this is 10 seconds so if a successful connection can&#039;t be made to the target website in under 10 seconds it will class that result as failed. This setting can be adjusted to any timeout value you desire.</yandex:full-text>

<link>http://31.220.48.156/1537-browseo-proxy-scraper.html</link>
<description>Name : BrowSEO Proxy Scraper Version : 2.6 Elite OS : Windows Type : Proxy Tools Price : $67 Homepage : SalePage There are some fairly big claims going on with this launch, namely that this very low cost product can replace your existing private proxy service. That would mean one small up front cost for the software and then no more monthly recurring fees as you would get with every private proxy company around.</description>

However, I&#039;m also open to cutting my monthly out goings so I decided to pick up a 3-PC license copy and put it to the test.</yandex:full-text>
