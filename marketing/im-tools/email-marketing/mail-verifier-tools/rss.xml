<description>Name : Email Verifier Version : Pro 6.3.42 OS : Windows Type : Email Marketing Tools Price : $44.95 Homepage : SalePage Bad email addresses, unsubscribers, and invalid domains can take a clean email list and contaminate it very fast. Fortunately, Email Verifier has all of the right tools within it to keep your contact list pure. In fact, it can work on a multitude of external databases, such as Microsoft Outlook, that may contain invalid email addresses that give an unrealistic view of how many valid recipients there are. When you can automatically clean your list easily, you know exactly how many people you are reaching. This prevents you from receiving a lot of bounced emails. Unfortunately, there are many ISPs that will block an IP if too many bounced emails come back to it. Using the right software to verify the validity of the email addresses you are sending to will keep this from happening to you. Email Verifier checks email addresses from Microsoft Outlook Contacts, Windows Address Book, Excel, Text Files and External databases to determine if they are still valid. &quot;Email Verifier is an advanced solution for power users, administrators and any person who send e-mail messages and needs to maintain a clean e-mail mailing list.&quot;</description>

<yandex:full-text>GSA Email Verifier, the email marketing tool, is quite simple to use. The program connects directly to the SMTP server of the email address to check it without sending the email. It works on the same algorithm as any ISP mail server. Import the email list you want to verify (import from Outlook, address book, Excel, CSV...) Click the verify button to start the multithreaded verification process Export the list again (various formats). This is the cleaned list for later use. In detail the program works exactly as a SMTP server. MX-Records are extracted from a Domain Name Server (DNS) of the email domain. The Verifier then connects directly to the SMTP server and simulates the sending of a message (nothing is sent to the recipient). A free defineable ruleset in the programs options let the software react on the response given from the server. These tests drastically reduce the number of bad email returns while increasing the accuracy of a mailing list. There is no need to disturb your clients and friends anymore to check if their email addresses are still valid. GSA Email Verifier works on all Windows platforms (including Windows Vista). Features for Email Verification Clear mailing lists from bounced and undeliverable email addresses Multithread connections - More than one email verification at a time Unlimited size of mailing list Import emails from any file format (including Excel, Text, CSV, Outlook...)
