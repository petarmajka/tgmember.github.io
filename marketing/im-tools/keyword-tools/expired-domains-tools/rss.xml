<description>Name : Expired Domain Finder Version : 1.0 OS : Windows Type : Expired Domain Finder Price : $0 Homepage : SalePage Expired Domain Finder is a 100% free and full (no trail) desktop application that allows users to find expired domains for free. For those of you who don&#039;t know expired domains are simply domains that were registered but are now expired as they have not been renewed by the owner. This can happen for many reasons, the person has lost interest in the project, the company has gone bust, the company has rebranded and many more reasons. So what would one use these domains for? Their backlink profile, its no secret the more backlinks a website has the higher it appears in Google. Once you find an expired domain with a strong backlink profile you then have two choices. Firstly you can use it as a money website, by money website we mean a website that you will use to generate a profit from, this will be your main website. Or you can use it to build a prive blog.comwork. A private blog.comwork is simply a.comwork of websites that you own that all link to your main websites (your money website) with the intention of making it rank higher by linking to it.</description>

As mentioned above these expired tumblrs can have fantastic backlink profiles just waiting to be pointed at your website. I&#039;ve seen people use nothing but 200 expired tumblrs to rank a website.

Expired tumblr hunter has two options. A niche related search and a non niche related search. If you want niche related expired tumblrs then enter your keywords that you&#039;re trying to rank for and it will find as many niche related ones as it can by scraping results from bing. The non-niche related option will search bing with random safe (non-spammy) keywords. It has a distinct advantage over many other tools that attempt this. Most tools will just check for a 404 error to singal its expired. This tool not only checks for a 404 but also checks if its available to register right now.

<yandex:full-text>[media=https://youtu.be/PEZT4zWJwCc] Features What is a PBN? A PBN is short for private blog.comwork. A private blog.comwork is a.comwork of websites that are used for the sole purpose of pushing up a single website in the seach engine positions. These websites that form the PBN are typically created from expired domains. So when a webmaster no longer wants a website or a business or charity no longer needs its website it expires and PBN owners purchase these domains. They then place backlinks on these PBN websites pointing to they&#039;re money website (the website they want to rank). Why should I use PBN Hunter? If a competitors backlink profile doesn&#039;t look quiet right for how high they&#039;re ranking then you should check with PBN hunter to see if they&#039;re being boosted up Google by a hidden PBN. Nobody wants to invest hundreds of hours into an amazing website only to realise you have no hope in hell in ranking because that keyword which looked so easy to rank for is actually being domainted by people with hundreds of PBN websites. How does PBN Hunter work? PBN Hunter works on the following premise. If a website owner has a website (our target website) about a computer game called &quot;Dead man X&quot; they will build their PBN websites pages containing the term &quot;Dead man X&quot; either in the link anchor text or somewhere in the page text. PBN hunter will take the term they are trying to rank for (&quot;Dead man X&quot;) and scrape every result from all major search engines about &quot;Dead man X&quot; it can find. Once it scrapes a page containing the term &quot;Dead man X&quot; it will check every outbound link on this page to see if its linking to the targeted website. If it finds a link to the target website it will also check if the website is blocking backlink crawlers such a MOZ and Ahrefs.</yandex:full-text>
