Both ways, it is an amazing SEO technique that has been working for many people for decades now. In fact, up until now it is has been a significant contribution to wonderful rankings of many authoritative sites you know out there in many niches. The biggest problem though with many people who use link building in their sites is that they regularly make use of bad practices that are set on cutting corners on responsibilities to achieve easy rankings. Google is comfortably able to capture and punish those that use these bad strategies using frequently algorithm updates. These tricks commonly known as black hat linking. You need to avoid these techniques in every possible way if you want to make your website become an authority in your niche and achieve the level of success you have in mind. The best way for you to keep off these bad practices is through getting to understand the very anatomy of link building. Having known the most important aspects of link building, you will be able to find out what&amp;rsquo;s best and what&amp;rsquo;s not and how to make the most of what&amp;rsquo;s best. So to help you get the gist of this useful SEO technique here is what you need to know about link building:</description>
<category>Tutorials</category>
<pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2016 00:22:09 -1000</pubDate>
<yandex:full-text>What is Link Building? This is basically having external links that point to your website on other external pages and posts of other websites. Link building gives more exposure to your site, get better rankings on popular search engines and direct a good deal of traffic to your site for conversions or sales or any other intended purpose. If you have links, especially in websites that have ranked in the first three positions in Google, Bing or Yahoo, it may have a huge positive impact regarding exposure on your site. Just take a second and think, how much traffic does the website that&amp;rsquo;s ranked the first get every day? A huge load of it! And what if you could tap into it and share the traffic with your site? That would really make a huge difference in your site. So if you can manage to talk that site&amp;rsquo;s owner into letting you leave a link or a couple of them there, you can get to see a significant rise in rankings in your online business. And that&amp;rsquo;s how link building came to be! No, Follow vs. Do Follow Links The do follow types of links have been around for a long time, but a no follow link has been around since 2005, after a dire need to solve the issue of spammers of other people&amp;rsquo;s sites securing good places for their sites in the search engines. Let&amp;rsquo;s catch a good glimpse of these types of links. A do follow link is a link that is counted as a point by Google search bots and adds more into the link juice that boosts a site&amp;rsquo;s rankings in the SERPs. What this basically means is that it is a link left on a website (like New York Times or Forbes), and it passes link power to the site where the link is pointing. Having more of these shows Google that many people are linking to a certain page to your site, which then means that the page must be really good. And in Google&amp;rsquo;s effort to deliver quality to their users, they will rank the page higher in the SERP&amp;rsquo;s to help many people find it and enjoy it as well. A no follow link is a link that doesn&amp;rsquo;t count in the placing of your site in the search engines. There is no link juice for this kind of link, which means that it&amp;rsquo;s not going to make any difference to the site of the person who left it. There is actually a HTML attribute for this link. Here it is -&amp;gt; &amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;rdquo;http://www.website.com/&amp;rdquo;; rel=&amp;rdquo;nofollow&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Link Text&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; What the attribute says is that this link should not count on its players. As said earlier, this link came to be after many people realized that the most inbound links there were for their sites, no matter where or how could gain them a boost. This later leads to a messy situation where links were all over the place, and now it was not a matter of authenticity but a dirty competition to win good positions. So getting the links not to make any difference or bring any pointers to their destination was the perfect solution. Are no follow links worth it then? Sure they are! Although they don&amp;rsquo;t exert any SEO energy, they usually serve a good way of getting referral traffic that can then be channel the traffic your site and give you a lot of leads and conversions too! If well placed as a blog comment or a post it can really make more impact than rankings would. The main reason for fighting for good rankings is to get more traffic, and if you get leads and conversions out of the no follow links instead of rankings, then they are well worth the short! Importance of Link Building in Ranking a Keyword If you are looking for making money online then you must rank your money keywords on Google top three positions. Link building is the way to go! If you have been wondering how to rank a keyword that you have found a fit for awesome conversions and would want to have a good placing under it, inbound links can help you do that. What you will only need to do is to write a good article on that keyword, a good informative and accurate content on that specific keyword and then get quality links for it once you have published it. What importance will this serve? Well, link building is all about leaving traces and tracks of your content in other people&amp;rsquo;s websites and social media. If you can manage leave as many traces as possible, it will make search engines aware of the great influence and link your article gets and how many clicks the article is getting too. They will perceive this way; if many people love this article, it must be a great one so let&amp;rsquo;s rank it on top so that all people can benefit from it also, as explained earlier. That&amp;rsquo;s how you are going to get a better ranking for that keyword. Popular Ways to Getting Backlinks So you are probably wondering, if this is how helpful building links for my website can be, how then can I build quality links the best way, right? There are many legit ways that search engines accept for bloggers to build links using, but there are those ways that give outstanding results. If you want to get such rewarding results, here are some of the best ways that even expert bloggers are using to build links for their websites: Guest Posting &amp;ndash; writing articles for an influential blog is one of the ways you can use to link your site to that blog. If the blog is good enough, you should be seeing results in days. What happens is that search engines rank influential sites quick, which means the article you will have written as a guest post will go on the web real quick. Related: Blogging Tips Blogs That Accept Guest Post At the middle of the article, you get a chance to naturally insert a link to your site. If you leverage this opportunity, you are sure to add some influence on your site. PBN&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; PBN stands for Private Blog Network; this involves a series of blogs owned by one person that are used to build links for another blog of that same person, which is most likely a money making blog. This strategy has become so popular, and it has been undoubtedly paying some bloggers, but the better part of it is draining the value and worth of your site. It is basically a black hat technique which Google detects and penalizes people for so the best recommendation for this is just to keep off of it. (More of this will be discussed later.) Web 2.0 &amp;ndash; This is a newer version of World Wide Web, which involves the transition of the older static pages of HTML to more dynamic ones that help users to work together and share different kinds of information on the web. This term had been used in a more technical way before that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite bring its impact. With this kind of technological advancement, it is easy to build many links to your site without having to add your own codes to the static HTML pages as it was before. Most popular web 2.0&amp;rsquo;s sites are BlogSpot, Weebly, WordPress, Tumblr, and Wix. Blog Comment &amp;ndash; this is another well-known tactic that people use. What happens here is that people go through other blogs on their niche and then in the comments section they leave a relevant comment that has a link to their article. Similar: How To Find Similar Niche Blogs for Blog Commenting This then comes to pay when other users come to that website and happen to go through the comments. If they happen to find the comment with the link to be somewhat enticing, they click on it and are taken to the website the link leads to. Article submission sites &amp;ndash; article submission sites are sites that have been created specifically for help website administrators and bloggers to market their articles and gain better rankings easy. There are thousands of such sites on the inte.com. If you happen to submit an article to those sites, especially the quality ones that have authority, Google will rank the article well which will help people know the author and use the links you have provided through the article to get to your site. Article submission sites are like Street articles, e-zine articles, Wikipedia and such. What these are, is that they are mainly sites that people have to write an article and post them on the said sites but leave some information about themselves and links to their sites. People will get to view the sites because some article directories get instant rankings on most search engines. Directories &amp;ndash; There has been a significant confusion between article directories and article submissions sites. Most popular directories that can boost your rank in the SERP are Dmoz and Yahoo directory. Don&amp;rsquo;t use directories excessively for your site because Google has devalued more than 90% directories in the past due to their spammy nature. Watch this video to know different ways of getting links Things to Avoid When Building Links There are some things you are going to want to keep away as do your link building if you want this tactic to add value to your website or blog. What will be listed below will only harm your campaigns and reputation in search engines and loose trust as well as good positions in the SERPs? So here is what you should avoid at all costs: PBNs &amp;ndash; As discussed earlier, private blog.comworks are a black hat method of achieving rankings. This is trying to creating a place for your site to thrive using your own blogs and leading engines to believe you are getting links from outside when in fact you are not. Many sites have been penalized heavily for this to the point of getting banned. Others have been ranked in the last pages and have never recovered from that for years. Avoid over-optimized anchor texts &amp;ndash; Anchor text plays a significant role in ranking your site. Moreover, if your link profile constitutes a lot of exact matches and commercial anchor text, then it attracts penalty from Google. You should diversify your anchor text and focus more on brand, generic and naked URLs. To summarize all that you should avoid, only one thing can be said, don&amp;rsquo;t try to fool Google or any other engine. It&amp;rsquo;s not worth it. Just try to build upon your branding. Make sure you are building quality links the right and accepted way, and this will earn you points and most importantly, trust, which is even stronger than points.

<turbo:content><![CDATA[<ol><br />  <li><br />    <h2><strong> What is Link Building?</strong></h2><br />  </li><br /></ol><br /><p>This is basically having external links that point to your website on other external pages and posts of other websites. Link building gives more exposure to your site, get better rankings on popular search engines and direct a good deal of traffic to your site for conversions or sales or any other intended purpose.</p><br /><p>If you have links, especially in websites that have ranked in the first three positions in Google, Bing or Yahoo, it may have a huge positive impact regarding exposure on your site. Just take a second and think, how much traffic does the website that&rsquo;s ranked the first get every day?</p><br /><p>A huge load of it! And what if you could tap into it and share the traffic with your site? That would really make a huge difference in your site.</p><br /><p>So if you can manage to talk that site&rsquo;s owner into letting you leave a link or a couple of them there, you can get to see a significant rise in rankings in your online business.</p><br /><p>And that&rsquo;s how link building came to be!</p><br /><ol start="2"><br />  <li><br />    <h2><strong> No, Follow vs. Do Follow Links</strong></h2><br />  </li><br /></ol><br /><p>The do follow types of links have been around for a long time, but a no follow link has been around since 2005, after a dire need to solve the issue of spammers of other people&rsquo;s sites securing good places for their sites in the search engines. Let&rsquo;s catch a good glimpse of these types of links.</p><br /><ul><br />  <li>A <strong>do follow link</strong> is a link that is counted as a point by Google search bots and adds more into the link juice that boosts a site&rsquo;s rankings in the SERPs. What this basically means is that it is a link left on a website (like New York Times or Forbes), and it passes link power to the site where the link is pointing.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Having more of these shows Google that many people are linking to a certain page to your site, which then means that the page must be really good. And in Google&rsquo;s effort to deliver quality to their users, they will rank the page higher in the SERP&rsquo;s to help many people find it and enjoy it as well.</p><br /><ul><br />  <li>A <strong>no follow link</strong> is a link that doesn&rsquo;t count in the placing of your site in the search engines. There is no link juice for this kind of link, which means that it&rsquo;s not going to make any difference to the site of the person who left it.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>There is actually a HTML attribute for this link. Here it is -&gt; &rdquo; &lt;a href=&rdquo;http://www.website.com/&rdquo;; rel=&rdquo;nofollow&rdquo;&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;</p><br /><p>What the attribute says is that this link should not count on its players. As said earlier, this link came to be after many people realized that the most inbound links there were for their sites, no matter where or how could gain them a boost.</p><br /><p>This later leads to a messy situation where links were all over the place, and now it was not a matter of authenticity but a dirty competition to win good positions. So getting the links not to make any difference or bring any pointers to their destination was the perfect solution.</p><br /><h4><strong>Are no follow links worth it then?</strong></h4><br /><p>Sure they are! Although they don&rsquo;t exert any SEO energy, they usually serve a good way of getting referral traffic that can then be channel the traffic your site and give you a lot of leads and conversions too! If well placed as a blog comment or a post it can really make more impact than rankings would.</p><br /><p>The main reason for fighting for good rankings is to <a href="http://31.220.48.156/increased-organic-traffic-91-long-tail-queries/" >get more traffic</a>, and if you get leads and conversions out of the no follow links instead of rankings, then they are well worth the short!</p><br /><ol start="3"><br />  <li><br />    <h2><strong> Importance of Link Building in Ranking a Keyword</strong></h2><br />  </li><br /></ol><br /><p>If you are looking for <a href="http://onlineearningmentor.com/"  target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">making money online</a> then you must rank your money keywords on Google top three positions. Link building is the way to go! If you have been wondering how to rank a keyword that you have found a fit for awesome conversions and would want to have a good placing under it, inbound links can help you do that.</p><br /><p>What you will only need to do is to write a good article on that keyword, a good informative and accurate content on that specific keyword and then get quality links for it once you have published it.</p><br /><p><strong>What importance will this serve?</strong></p><br /><p>Well, link building is all about leaving traces and tracks of your content in other people&rsquo;s websites and social media. If you can manage leave as many traces as possible, it will make search engines aware of the great influence and link your article gets and how many clicks the article is getting too.</p><br /><p>They will perceive this way; if many people love this article, it must be a great one so let&rsquo;s rank it on top so that all people can benefit from it also, as explained earlier. That&rsquo;s how you are going to <a href="http://31.220.48.156/10-ways-build-high-quality-backlinks/" >get a better ranking</a> for that keyword.</p><br /><ol start="4"><br />  <li><br />    <h2><strong> Popular Ways to Getting Backlinks</strong></h2><br />  </li><br /></ol><br /><p>So you are probably wondering, if this is how helpful building links for my website can be, how then can I build quality links the best way, right? There are many legit ways that search engines accept for bloggers to build links using, but there are those ways that give outstanding results. If you want to get such rewarding results, here are some of the best ways that even expert bloggers are using to build links for their websites:</p><br /><ul><br />  <li><strong> Guest Posting</strong> &ndash; writing articles for an influential blog is one of the ways you can use to link your site to that blog. If the blog is good enough, you should be seeing results in days. What happens is that search engines rank influential sites quick, which means the article you will have written as a guest post will go on the web real quick.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Related: <a href="http://31.220.48.156/blogging-tips-blogs-that-accepting-guest-posts/" >Blogging Tips Blogs That Accept Guest Post</a></strong></p><br /><p>At the middle of the article, you get a chance to naturally insert a link to your site. If you leverage this opportunity, you are sure to add some influence on your site.</p><br /><ul><br />  <li><strong> PBN&rsquo;s</strong> &ndash; PBN stands for Private Blog Network; this involves a series of blogs owned by one person that are used to build links for another blog of that same person, which is most likely a money making blog. This strategy has become so popular, and it has been undoubtedly paying some bloggers, but the better part of it is draining the value and worth of your site.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>It is basically a black hat technique which Google detects and penalizes people for so the best recommendation for this is just to keep off of it. (More of this will be discussed later.)</p><br /><ul><br />  <li><strong> Web 2.0</strong> &ndash; This is a newer version of World Wide Web, which involves the transition of the older static pages of HTML to more dynamic ones that help users to work together and share different kinds of information on the web.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>This term had been used in a more technical way before that didn&rsquo;t quite bring its impact. With this kind of technological advancement, it is easy to build many links to your site without having to add your own codes to the static HTML pages as it was before. <a href="http://31.220.48.156/web-2-0-sites-list/" >Most popular web 2.0&rsquo;s sites</a> are BlogSpot, <a href="https://www.weebly.com/"  target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Weebly</a>, WordPress, <a class="seoquake-nofollow" href="http://manik018.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Tumblr</a>, and Wix.</p><br /><ul><br />  <li><strong> Blog Comment</strong> &ndash; this is another well-known tactic that people use. What happens here is that people go through other blogs on their niche and then in the comments section they leave a relevant comment that has a link to their article.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Similar: <a href="http://31.220.48.156/how-to-find-similar-blogs/" >How To Find Similar Niche Blogs for Blog Commenting</a></strong></p><br /><p>This then comes to pay when other users come to that website and happen to go through the comments. If they happen to find the comment with the link to be somewhat enticing, they click on it and are taken to the website the link leads to.</p><br /><ul><br />  <li><strong> Article submission sites</strong> &ndash; <a href="http://31.220.48.156/high-pr-dofollow-article-directory-sites/" >article submission sites</a> are sites that have been created specifically for help website administrators and bloggers to market their articles and gain better rankings easy.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>There are thousands of such sites on the inte.com. If you happen to submit an article to those sites, especially the quality ones that have authority, Google will rank the article well which will help people know the author and use the links you have provided through the article to get to your site.</p><br /><p>Article submission sites are like Street articles, e-zine articles, Wikipedia and such. What these are, is that they are mainly sites that people have to write an article and post them on the said sites but leave some information about themselves and links to their sites. People will get to view the sites because some article directories get instant rankings on most search engines.</p><br /><ul><br />  <li><strong> Directories</strong> &ndash; There has been a significant confusion between article directories and article submissions sites. Most <a href="http://31.220.48.156/high-pr-dofollow-blog-directory-list/" >popular directories</a> that can boost your rank in the SERP are <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/"  target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Dmoz</a> and Yahoo directory. Don&rsquo;t use directories excessively for your site because Google has devalued more than 90% directories in the past due to their spammy nature.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3><strong>Watch this video to know different ways of getting links</strong></h3><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkLFlaWxgJA?rel=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><h2><strong>Things to Avoid When Building Links</strong></h2><br /><p>There are some things you are going to want to keep away as do your link building if you want this tactic to add value to your website or blog. What will be listed below will only harm your campaigns and reputation in search engines and loose trust as well as good positions in the SERPs? So here is what you should avoid at all costs:</p><br /><ul><br />  <li><strong> PBNs</strong> &ndash; As discussed earlier, private blog.comworks are a black hat method of achieving rankings. This is trying to creating a place for your site to thrive using your own blogs and leading engines to believe you are getting links from outside when in fact you are not. Many sites have been penalized heavily for this to the point of getting banned. Others have been ranked in the last pages and have never recovered from that for years.</li><br />  <li><strong>Avoid over-optimized anchor texts</strong> &ndash; Anchor text plays a significant role in ranking your site. Moreover, if your link profile constitutes a lot of exact matches and commercial anchor text, then it attracts penalty from Google. You should diversify your anchor text and focus more on brand, generic and naked URLs.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>To summarize all that you should avoid, only one thing can be said, don&rsquo;t try to fool Google or any other engine. It&rsquo;s not worth it. Just try to build upon your branding. Make sure you are building quality links the right and accepted way, and this will earn you points and most importantly, trust, which is even stronger than points.</p><br /><h3><strong>Author Bio</strong></h3><br /><p><strong>Yasir Khan</strong> is the owner of <a href="http://onlineearningmentor.com/"  target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">onlineearningmentor.com</a>.

<description>We all know that long tail keywords is the new strategy to get ranked fast on Google. Long tail keywords have a very low competition with good search volume.

<yandex:full-text>Today I am going to reveal my secret of integrating long keywords on your website to get maximum organic traffic.

I personally prefer webmaster to utilize long tail keywords in dynamic content of your website. When I say dynamic content, that means I am talking about content that can be updated frequently. Like Blog Posts, Youtube videos, infographics etc. Below are the few tips for you to integrate the long tail keywords in your content. 1-Optimize the Title of your Article: Let say we are working on a website that provide body building supplements. Here is my long tail keyword I have selected for content optimization. &amp;ldquo;Body Building Supplements for beginners&amp;rdquo; and I have googled this keyword. Here are the results. The first four listings have properly optimized titles for the selected keywords. Google still gives credit to optimize titles and take them into account while ranking any webpage. 2-Optimize the Headings for your page Let&amp;rsquo;s get to the fourth listing we have found on google.

The webpage has 800-1200 word content, and the webmaster has used his desired keyword only one time on webpage. However, he has used word &amp;ldquo;Supplements&amp;rdquo; 12 times. This shows us that his first priority was the web users and then secondly, he focused on search engines. 4-Optimize the images long tail keywords Long tail keywords can be used in image optimization. Sticking with the same example, when you see this first image in this article. You will find that this image contains optimized alternate text with keyword &amp;ldquo;Best Supplements For Beginners&amp;rdquo;. 5-Internal linking with long tail keywords Anchor Internal linking is an awesome way to get indexed and ranked fast, I always suggestion SEOs to do internal linking.

<yandex:full-text>Keep away from exercising a 404 error on your old content because this type of error gives the impression that there is a fault with your page. This damages your brand credibility. Use a 404 only when you want your page to be dead i.e. not accessed by anyone anymore. In the case of a 404 error message try to make the visitors still interested in your content by adding a few images and links at the end of the message. The links will take the viewers to your newly published attractive content which in turn will take their minds off from the unappealing 404. You can apply a 301 permanent redirect by creating a customized note where you mention the reason due to which the user is being redirected to other websites. To avoid confusion in the minds of your customers, be clear why they are being redirected by stating in a message that you are sorry for causing inconvenience and that the product is no longer accessible. While using 301 you can direct users to a new place where they have the option of getting something valuable and this would make up for the unnecessary hassle. Keep the expired content on the site. This might surprise and shock you at the same time, but research shows that if the past content was interesting and provided valuable knowledge to the users keeping it intact might help you indirectly. For example, if there was a poll on the most popular thing sold on your site in a particular month, then keep that information still there and let the users know that they can keep a tab on your polling section for future polls which will prove to be beneficial for them to decide what to buy and what to give a miss. But be sure to keep only valuable expired content since if you try to maintain all the old and new stuff simultaneously on your site, it will not only create confusion to both you and the users but your site may also crash and cause harassment. One needs to revise past content for the following reasons: To boost your brand&amp;rsquo;s image: No one will want to rely on your old content when your competitors like the SEO agency in Syracuse are coming up with new and exciting content every day. You need to showcase your worth by trying to eliminate completion and be in your customer&amp;rsquo;s good books. One of the ways to achieve this is to constantly update your site. Be in the good books of Google: You should examine your content on a daily basis and check whether its quality is being neglected or not. You need to be careful when you do this since Google Panda marks weak content. You can make your content updated by certain ways: Reimprovise your posts by checking the facts. In this digital age, things seldom remain the same and so you need to modify all the statistics and data if and when it is required. If the links become old and replaceable, you change them before they become outdated. You also need to consider the SEO. Apart from keeping the URL the same as before you should also stop yourself from changing the headlines and key phrases. Reformat your content so that it becomes easily readable to the average person. Keep the paragraphs short and avoid unnecessary complicated words. Highlight the best parts and include images if possible. CTAS should be replaced to make your posts apt for your target audience. After you have made the required changes, it is time to republish and redistribute your material. One clever way to attract the viewer is to change the date of publication to show that your information is current. Once you get a rough idea about how to handle your old and outdated content, you must classify all the terminated pages and then decide which source to use. Some pages might need 301 redirection while 404 error messages are suitable for others. Ultimately, it is in your hand to decide what goes best for your website and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t when it comes to old content.</yandex:full-text>

But be sure to keep only valuable expired content since if you try to maintain all the old and new stuff simultaneously on your site, it will not only create confusion to both you and the users but your site may also crash and cause harassment.</li><br /></ol><br /><h3>One needs to revise past content for the following reasons:</h3><br /><ul><br />  <li>To boost your brand&rsquo;s image: No one will want to rely on your old content when your competitors like the <a class="seoquake-nofollow" href="http://www.thegoodmonster.com/services/search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">SEO agency in Syracuse</a> are coming up with new and exciting content every day. You need to showcase your worth by trying to eliminate completion and be in your customer&rsquo;s good books. One of the ways to achieve this is to constantly update your site.</li><br />  <li>Be in the good books of Google: You should examine your content on a daily basis and check whether its quality is being neglected or not. You need to be careful when you do this since Google Panda marks weak content.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>You can make your content updated by certain ways:</h3><br /><ol><br />  <li>Reimprovise your posts by checking the facts. In this digital age, things seldom remain the same and so you need to modify all the statistics and data if and when it is required. If the links become old and replaceable, you change them before they become outdated. You also need to <a href="http://www.bloggingshout.com/on-page-seo-checklist/"  target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">consider the SEO</a>. Apart from keeping the URL the same as before you should also stop yourself from changing the headlines and key phrases.</li><br />  <li>Reformat your content so that it becomes easily readable to the average person. Keep the paragraphs short and avoid unnecessary complicated words. Highlight the best parts and include images if possible.</li><br />  <li>CTAS should be replaced to make your posts apt for your target audience.</li><br />  <li>After you have made the required changes, it is time to republish and redistribute your material. One clever way to attract the viewer is to change the date of publication to show that your information is current.</li><br /></ol><br /><p>Once you get a rough idea about how to handle your old and outdated content, you must classify all the terminated pages and then decide which source to use. Some pages might need 301 redirection while 404 error messages are suitable for others. Ultimately, it is in your hand to decide what goes best for your website and what doesn&rsquo;t when it comes to old content.</p>]]></turbo:content>
